Reviewed in the United States on October 24, 2023	Sidney	yes	yes	Buyer Beware	I excitedly ordered these gummies as it looked like a viable option for me to have the sweets I so miss from before my diagnosis. I had 4 pieces today of the watermelon, and the taste was incredible! The texture was not perfect but not bad for â€œcandyâ€. However, within 10 minutes my stomach started grumbling, and by the 30 minute mark I was keeled over vomiting into the toilet. What followed that is probably not appropriate for a review, but be warned, these will destroy your insides	1	-	-	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TZ9HIOFIRUYQ/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BPZXT7HJ	B0BPZXT7HJ	Flavor Name: Variety | Size: 6 Pack

Man these taste great at first but the after taste is horrid. It taste like a mouth full of cold medicine. The cherry expecially is rough. Candy cough medicine. I love the texture and smell but the taste of all 3 is not great to me.	2	-	-	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAQQ0YT3LSSQ6/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BPZXT7HJ	B0BPZXT7HJ	Flavor Name: Variety | Size: 6 Pack
Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2023	Arlene Mahon	yes	yes	Tastes terrible	I have never tasted anything like this.  It's terrible.  They give you individual bags and you can't return any of them.  I have to throw them away because they are that bad.  I never write reviews but only when I feel strong about not only how bad the product is but how unfair it is that you are not allowed to return something that is horrible and a waste of a lot of money.I must update this to say that the sellers were great with contacting me and letting me know that they were willing to offer me a full refund since I did not enjoy the product.  That is something that is worth mentioning and a definite change to my original thought so I have updated the review and added a few stars.	3	-	-	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RG2VX861MCK1Z/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BPZXT7HJ	B0BPZXT7HJ	Flavor Name: Variety | Size: 6 Pack
Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2023	Carrie T	yes	yes	Watermelon is great - others not so much :(	Update - added a star for amazing customer service. Seller contact me right away and offered a resolution.I got the variety pack, watermelon/pineapple/cherry. The watermelon tastes amazing! The pineapple was not quite as tasty but I will probably still eat it. The cherry is not good at all. It tastes like bad cough medicine and leaves a horrible aftertaste. Into the trash go both bags of cherry. A bit disappointed that 1/3 of the order will be thrown away, considering it was 22$ for the pack. Would probably buy just the watermelon if available.	4	-	-	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25EH1O5V6CQGB/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BPZXT7HJ	B0BPZXT7HJ	Flavor Name: Variety | Size: 6 Pack

It's always hard to find a Keto-friendly treat that has a great flavor and texture- and these candies are really tasty! But I suggest pacing yourself.  Don't polish off a whole bag in one sitting- unless you are home. Alone.

Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2023	Arthi Kumar	yes	yes	Great Guilt-Free Gummy	I'm always on the hunt for new "guilt-free" candies that satisfy my sweet tooth and I've tried a multitude of brands. With all the recent news about sweetener alternatives (aspartame, erythritol, etc), I came across Oomph!. They are sweetened with "allulose", a natural sweetener found in raisins and figs and isn't absorbed by your body (which allows for net carbs to be extremely low for a gummy).I found the taste to be just sweet enough to satisfy my cravings and chewiness was perfect without the gummy bites getting stuck to my teeth. Watermelon was a personal favorite but you can't go wrong with any of the flavors. Hopefully they'll make more varieties, I'm a huge fan!	5	-	-	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R367KY0UTVMTOA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BPZXT7HJ	B0BPZXT7HJ	Flavor Name: Variety | Size: 6 Pack

Reviewed in the United States on July 13, 2023	Meggie McRaeMeggie McRae	yes	yes	An awesome, healthy option!	Oomph gummies are just what Iâ€™ve been looking for! I have an occasional sweet tooth and my boyfriend loves candy. However, itâ€™s hard to justify eating a ton of sugar and harmful artificial dyes & other ingredients. Oomph has provided us with an alternative that we donâ€™t have to feel guilty for indulging in. While all of the flavors are tasty, my favorites are the watermelon and pineapple. The fact that they are low sugar and gluten free make them the perfect sweet treat for me as well since I have a gluten intolerance. I definitely recommend these!	5	https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71b19vNr5aL.jpg , https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91sW9oVowLL.jpg	-	https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2F7GASZ7ZHSUM/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BPZXT7HJ	B0BPZXT7HJ	Flavor Name: Variety | Size: 6 Pack
